# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**Insightful model development and analysis for predicting customer churn in the telecom domain.**

---

## 🚩 Overview

Designed to help telecom providers anticipate customer churn by analyzing real-world metrics and behaviors—allowing strategic customer retention.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

- Churn prediction is vital for reducing revenue loss and improving customer retention.
- This project uses structured telecom data (~7,000-8,000 rows, ~20 features) to predict which customers are likely to cancel services.

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, label encoding, normalization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform raw inputs into predictive features like tenure, contract type, usage patterns.
- **Model Training**: Evaluated classification models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ensemble approaches.
- **Model Selection**: Selected top-performing classifier using **cross-validated F1-score**, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix insights.

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Final model achieved approximately **80% accuracy**, with solid **F1-score** performance across validation sets.
- Key churn drivers identified included:
  - Duration of contract
  - Monthly service fees
  - Service upgrade status
  - Customer tenure
